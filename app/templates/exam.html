    <p>I’m Garrett Gauthreaux from Johns Creek, GA, and I’m currently working on my master’s at Georgia College. I also work as a graduate assistant at the Wellness and Recreation Center, which keeps me busy but is really rewarding. When I’m not studying or working, I love spending time with my girlfriend, Bella.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading, and I’m a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson. The Well of Ascension is my top pick among his books. However, my all-time favorite book is The Name of the Wind. When I’m not lost in a good book, I enjoy playing Rainbow Six Siege on Xbox. It’s a great way to unwind and have some fun.</p>
    <p>My parents, Dale and Darcy, met while they were at Purdue, and both are now working in the Atlanta area. My brother, who’s two years older than me, graduated from UGA, while my sister, who’s four years older, played volleyball at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. It’s great to have my family close by, and I’m planning to stay around the Atlanta area after I graduate to be near them.</p>
